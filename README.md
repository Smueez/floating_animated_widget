        required this.child,
        required this.floatingWidget,
        required this.floatingWidgetWidth,
        required this.floatingWidgetHeight,
        required this.dy,
        required this.dx,
        this.speed,
        this.isDraggble = true,
        this.autoAlign = false,
    });
```
### Where:

-   **Child** is required and it accept any **widget**. This is actually the base Widget or the parent widget on where the floating widget will be dragged or moved.
-   **floatingWidget** is also required and it accept any **widget**. This is actually the particular widget which will be floated and can be mode or dragged around the screen.

-  **dy** accepts a **double** value which is the distance from the top of the screen where floating widget will be positioned initially .
-  **dx** it accepts a **double** value which is the distance from the left of the screen where floating widget will be positioned initially.
-  **speed** accepts a **double** value which is the speed factor of the floating widget after it will be let go. The more **speed** will be provided the slower the object will move after the user let the widget go freely.
-  **isDraggable** accepts a **boolean** value which determines if the widget is draggable of not.

      ),
      home: const MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyHomePage({Key? key, required this.title}) : super(key: key);

  final String title;

  @override
  State<MyHomePage> createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  int _counter = 0;

  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {

      _counter++;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {

    return FloatingDraggableWidget(
      child: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(

          title: Text(widget.title),
        ),
        body: Center(

          child: Column(

            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,

            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
      floatingWidget: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _incrementCounter,
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: const Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
      floatingWidgetHeight: 40,
      floatingWidgetWidth: 40,
      dx: 200,
      dy: 300
    );
  }
}

```
### Known Limitations
- Doesn't have functionality of floating on other apps.
- It dose not automatically calculate the size of the parent widget it always take the whole screen to float around.
